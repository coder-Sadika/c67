Past Awakin Call guest Sarah Peyton offers a special 2.5-hour New Year’s session and interactive workshop on releasing the contracts that block us from experiencing joy in our
lives. We will also look at what Sarah terms “false” Bodhisattva vows, and how to distinguish such false vows involving unhealthy self-sacrifice from those of joyful service. A long-time senior trainer of non-violent communication, Sarah’s work explores tools of relational neuroscience that help one turn inward with kindness, warmth, and curiosity and create opportunities for self-healing.


Awakin Calls is an initiative of ServiceSpace, a global, all-volunteer community dedicated to small acts of great love. Our webinar and podcast series highlights the outer work and inner journeys of individuals who are transforming our world in large and small ways. We aim to inspire and seed shifts in consciousness by highlighting paradigm-shifting ways of being and doing in the world. We are a heart-centered learning community across wisdom traditions exploring the ServiceSpace principle of “change yourself, change the world”. We organize our processes in accordance with the principles we seek to lift up, and so each conversation is co-created by a team of volunteers distributed across the world, in a spirit of intrinsically motivated service and kinship.

Conversations with changemakers to inspire deeper awareness and transformative action. Exploring inner journeys to expand outer edges. Each offering is co-created by a team of volunteers distributed across the world, in the spirit of service and kinship.
