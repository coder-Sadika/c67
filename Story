Past Awakin Call guest Sarah Peyton offers a special 2.5-hour New Year’s session and interactive workshop on releasing the contracts that block us from experiencing joy in our
lives. We will also look at what Sarah terms “false” Bodhisattva vows, and how to distinguish such false vows involving unhealthy self-sacrifice from those of joyful service. A long-time senior trainer of non-violent communication, Sarah’s work explores tools of relational neuroscience that help one turn inward with kindness, warmth, and curiosity and create opportunities for self-healing.
